      <h1 class="text-center mb-4"><h1 class="text-white">The Queen</h1></h1>
      <p class="text-white">The next day, Edward and Noel were happily taking their daily walk when Noel thought she heard a voice calling up from a steel sewer grate in the ground.</p>
      <p class="text-white">She ran over to the grate and called down “Is there anyone down there?” Edward ran over too, and they both heard a soft ladylike voice whisper “Oh please help me! I am a Queen and am stuck down here in this horrible sewer and there is a fierce dragon after me!”</p>
      <p class="text-white">Well, you can imagine that Noel was quite frightened, for after all she was only a very small (possibly) future Princess. I am not quite certain of how Edward was feeling at this moment, but perhaps it is best not to ask too many questions.</p>
      <p class="text-white">Noel looked up bravely at Edward and said; “We must save her, my Prince; it is our duty as a future Princess and Prince to help those in distress!” Edward sighed and nodded; “I suppose you are right, Noel, something must be done immediately, if not sooner.”</p>
      <p class="text-white">Edward was now getting a bit tired of this game, and all he really wanted to do was take a nice, long nap. But he knew Noel would not relent, so he grabbed her hand and shouted; “Alright, come on!” So they tugged very hard on the grate to open it, and down they went, into the dark, scary sewer.</p>
