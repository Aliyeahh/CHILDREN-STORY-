        <p>Noel and Edward both landed on their feet (thank goodness!) but wouldn’t you know it, they were immediately faced with a fierce, fire-spouting angry dragon. He was very upset that someone was interrupting his lovely soon-to-be dinner and made no bones about it. He growled so loudly that bright bursts of orange flames blew out of his two green nostrils, but Noel was not afraid.</p>
        <p>"Come on, Prince, we have to rescue the Queen!" she cried, and took his hand into hers. It was not a moment too soon, as the fierce dragon was now approaching the queen and licking his wicked, green dragon lips in anticipation of a delicious-royal-type-of-dinner. They could see right away that she was a true queen. She was very beautiful and never cried once. She showed no fear, but told them that she had been kidnapped and mercilessly thrown into the sewer by an evil witch.</p>
        <p>Just in time, the darkness filled with light as dozens of beautiful winged fairies of every size and description descended down into the blackness and gave off their beautiful hues of bright color in a rainbow of red, blue, green, orange, yellow, purple and pink. So much light filled the sewer that the dragon became confused, and ran away to hide.</p>
        <p>At once, Edward picked up the distressed Queen, took Noels hand, and together they climbed out of the sewer and back into the bright sunlight. Edward gently laid the queen down on the grass and sighed. “Well, thank goodness for the fairies, anyway.”</p>  
        <p>He was quite exhausted. After all, this was a little more adventure than he had bargained for. But Noel’s eyes were shining and she softly smoothed the Queen’s forehead to comfort her.</p>
