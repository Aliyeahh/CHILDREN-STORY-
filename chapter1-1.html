      <h1 class="text-center mb-4"><h1 class="text-white">Noel and Edward</h1></h1>
      <p class="text-white">He and Noel were good friends and would go on long walks together. Edward would explain to Noel all about what was involved in becoming a Princess. “Why, my future Princess,” he would say, “You must look with your Princess eyes and then you will see the beautiful fairies glittering amongst the trees.”</p>
      <p class="text-white">Sure enough, when Noel concentrated really hard and looked with her future Princess eyes, she could see the beautiful glittering fairies, just like Edward had said.</p>
      <p class="text-white">One day they took a walk near the dark forest. Edward suddenly cried out to Noel, “Look, my soon-to-be-Princess, there is a pure white Unicorn hiding in the dark forest!” And sure enough, when Noel looked very deeply into the forest with her new future Princess type of eyes, she could see the beautiful, shy Unicorn hiding behind the trees.</p>
      <p class="text-white">Noel went home that night and was so enraptured with all this that she didn’t even notice what was on her plate for dinner. In addition to consuming a rather large slice of her mother’s homemade meatloaf (which she secretly detested), she also polished off 3 small pieces of broccoli and ate one bite of cauliflower without a single complaint</p>
      <p class="text-white">Her mother was so proud of her that she gave her a big bowl of chocolate pudding for dessert, with extra whipped cream on top.</p>
      <p class="text-white">Her sister was none too happy with this turn of events, and complained bitterly until she, too, was given a bowl of pudding, but much smaller and with only a very small dollop of whipped cream on top. Then both girls were sent upstairs to finish their homework, which pleased no one at all.</p>
